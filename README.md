# Array-and-String-Operations
This repository contains a collection of programming problems focused on performing operations with arrays, strings, and structures. The tasks are designed to improve understanding of fundamental programming concepts and logical problem-solving.

1D Array Tasks:
1. Find the sum of even/odd numbers.
2. Reverse an array.
3. Sort the array (smaller to bigger).
4. Find a number in an array.
5. Find the minimum/ maximum value of an array.
6. Find the 2nd minimum/ maximum value of an array.

2D Array Tasks:
7. Find the values/elements and calculate the sum of the primary diagonal.
8. Find the elements and calculate the sum of the secondary diagonal.
9. Find the elements and calculate the sum of the middle column.
10 Find the elements and calculate the sum of the middle row.

Pattern:
11. Create a triangular pattern with n rows where each row contains stars (*) equal to its row number.
12. Create an inverted triangular pattern with n rows. The first row contains n stars (*), and each subsequent row contains one less star than the previous row.

String Tasks:
13. Take input of two strings and perform the following operations:
	a) Find the length of each string.
	b) Find the larger string.
	c) Concatenate the two strings.
	d) Copy the new string into an empty string.
	e) Find the lexicographically larger string between the two strings.
	f) Divide a string into equal parts.
	g) Find the number of words in a string.
	h) Find the number of digits, consonants, vowels, and special characters in a string.

14. Take a string and print it in the following way:
Input: Orpon
Output:
	    O
	    Or
	    Orp
	    Orpo
	    Orpon

Structure Tasks:
15. Write an array of structures to store and view information of 10 students or more (Name, ID, CGPA, Age, Courses) and Calculate the total CGPA of all students.

Function:
16. Find the sum of even number in a given range to solve it by using user-defined function.
17. Print the fibonnacci series.
18. Factorial of n terms.

Run Problem
rename it and remove the dot(.).
